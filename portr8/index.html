        <h2>How it all began — from the CEO</h2>
        <p>It was late December, 2017. I was in Ghana on a vacation
        visiting my wife's family. My wife and I were staying a few days in
        Osu, a neighborhood of Accra. I was wandering some side streets
        while my wife had a meeting at a nearby art shop and cafe. </p>
